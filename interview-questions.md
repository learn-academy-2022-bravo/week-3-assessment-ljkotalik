# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: a keyword that holds the objects

  Researched answer: 'this' is a JS keyword that refers to the object it belongs to and references the function that is being executed.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a library and is used to make webpages and mobile webpages and is what the user sees.

  Researched answer: Created from Facebook, React creates interactive webpages. It handles user interactions and reacts to changes made by the user without refreshing the page. It is component-based, meaning it allows us to build smaller parts and then join them together to form a whole app. It is used to build mobile apps and mobile webpages, and regular webpages. It relies on a virtual DOM.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: render method

  Researched answer: render method



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a mashup of html and Javascript. You can't put JS in HTML, but you can put Javascript inside of JSX by using curly braces and writing the Javascript inside those.

  Researched answer: JSX is basically a joining of html and Javascript. The biggest difference is that className is used for JSX whereas class is only used for html.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a package of a ton of files that get downloaded to your local. The files .js and .css are modified.

  Researched answer: Created by Facebook, Yarn is a software packing system for Node.js. It installs dependencies for projects.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: a function in Javascript that doesn't need a name?

  Researched answer: It is a function that does not have an identifier which also means that this type of funcion is typically not accessible again after it's initially created. In order to call the anon function later, we must assign it a variable. It is common to use anon functions to pass as arguments to other functions.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Conditional rendering works the same way that consitions do in JS. It provides the ability use different UI markup depending upon if the condition is true or false. In React, we have the ability to create individual components that can render the behavior that each of them encapsulates depending on the condition of the app.

2. Object-oriented programming: Object Oriented programming, aka OO, is a programming paradigm that uses the concept of classes and objects. In earlier days, programmers realized that they needed a way to organize their code into individual containers, so they could update certain parts of their code without breaking the whole code. They needed certain code blocks to work independently of each other. This can be done by using classes to create individual instances of objects. Examples of OOP are Jaavascript, Python, C++, and Ruby.

3. Ruby: Ruby is an OOP that plentiful build-in methods and documentation that is open source. It is a dynamic interpreted language. In Ruby "everything is an object", or so the mantra says. It is user-friendly and is very versatile. Ruby can be used for web scraping, website generation, command-line tools, automation, development operations, and data processing.

4. Ruby blocks: Blocks are the anonnymous functions in Ruby.  They are code that gets passed to a method.

5. Ruby hashes: Hashes are conatiners where we can store collections of key:value pairs. They are considered enumerable which means we can use methods to iterate such as .map.
